# track-time_snowpack-react-chakra-prisma

This is a test project building some todo/time-tracking app using:

- [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) as a fast build tool (instead of webpack, Parcel)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for a reactive UI
- [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) as UI component library
  - [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)
  - maybe try [Formik](https://formik.org/) for forms
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as ORM (instead of [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) which I had some issues [[1](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3238)] [[2](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/4122)] with in https://github.com/vogler/syncmine)
  - sqlite as database

Tried Svelte and Firebase in an older iteration: https://github.com/vogler/track-time_svelte-firebase.
By now Svelte seems to officially support TypeScript: https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-and-typescript.
